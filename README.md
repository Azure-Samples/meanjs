# MEAN.js sample for Azure App Service

This is a sample application that you can use to follow along with the tutorial at 
[Build a Node.js and MongoDB web app in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service-web/app-service-web-tutorial-nodejs-mongodb-app). 

This sample application is taken from the official [MEAN.js repository](https://github.com/meanjs/mean) and modified minimally to make it work with Azure App Service. For instructions on how to use MEAN.js, see the official repository. 

To learn how to build this sample step by step, see [Running Mean.js App on Azure App Services with Continuous Integration and Delivery](https://prmadi.com/running-mean-js-app-on-azure-app-services/).
